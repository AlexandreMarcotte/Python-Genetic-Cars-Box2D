# Python-Genetic-Cars-Box2D

A python implementation of generating cars using genetic programming with Box2D library.

## Libraries used:
- [Box2D](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d) (dependant on pygame)

## Usage:
```
python genetic_car_sim.py
```
  
  
  
  
  
  
TODO:
- Add GUI to control the properties of the cars (add,delete,modify shape and size)
- Clean the code
- More comments
- Add function to focus on individual cars
- Better algorithm

Any suggestion and modifications are welcome! :)

I was inspired to do this after playing around with [BoxCar2D](http://boxcar2d.com/).
