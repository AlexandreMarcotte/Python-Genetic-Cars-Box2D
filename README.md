Libraries used:
[Box2D](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d) (dependant on pygame)


TODO:
- Add GUI to control the properties of the cars (add,delete,modify shape and size)
- Clean the code
- More comments
- Add function to focus on individual cars
- Better algorithm

Any suggestion and modifications are welcome! :)

I was inspired to do this after playing around with [BoxCar2D](http://boxcar2d.com/).
